    """
        This class computes a velocity trajectory from a starting speed to a desired
        speed. It works in unison with the Behavioral plannner  as it needs to build a
        velocity profile for each of the states that the vehicle can be in.
        In the "Follow_lane" state we need to either speed up or speed down to maintain
        a speed target. In the "decel_to_stop" state we need to create a profile that
        allows us to decelerate smoothly to a stop line.

        The order of precedence for handling these cases is stop sign handling and then
        nominal lane maintenance. In a real velocity planner you would need to handle
        the coupling between these states, but for simplicity this project can be
        implemented by isolating each case.

        For all trajectories, the required acceleration is given by _a_max (confortable
        accel).
        Look at the structs.h for details on the types of manuevers/states that the
        behavior planner can be in.
